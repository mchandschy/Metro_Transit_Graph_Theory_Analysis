### What is this repository for? ###

During the 2016 Transit Onboard Survey, Metro Transit customers were surveyed during their transit trips. As part of the survey they were asked about their trip origins and destinations. These origins and destinations are associated to a census tract. The census tracts form nodes of a graph. Two nodes are connected by an edge if there is a trip between the two tracts, and the edges are weighted by the number of trips taken along the edge. The code and documents in this repository analyze the resulting graph.
